# discription:
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on text data from two key sources: tweets and product or service reviews. The primary objective is to automatically determine the emotional tone behind the text â€” classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.

Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the system processes raw text to identify patterns in language that indicate sentiment. The project supports:

>>Real-time social media monitoring (e.g., analyzing tweets for public opinion or brand sentiment).
>>Customer feedback analysis (e.g., reviews from e-commerce or service platforms to gauge satisfaction).

The model pipeline includes:
->Data preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, etc.)
->Vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or transformer embeddings)
->Classification using models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or deep learning approaches like LSTM or BERT.

This sentiment analysis tool can be used by businesses to make data-driven decisions, improve customer experience, and monitor brand reputation effectively.
